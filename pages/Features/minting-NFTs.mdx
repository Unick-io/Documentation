# ðŸŒ± Minting NFTs

Minting an NFT means creating a unique digital asset and registering it on a blockchain as a non-fungible token (NFT).
Once minted, the NFT can be bought, sold, and traded like any other cryptocurrency, and its ownership and provenance can be tracked on the blockchain. 
The value of an NFT can vary depending on factors such as its uniqueness, popularity, and demand in the market.
