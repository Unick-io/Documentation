# 🔀 Marketplace Aggregator


## ❓ What is a Marketplace Aggregator?

An NFT marketplace aggregator is a platform or service that allows users to search and view NFTs from multiple NFT marketplaces in one place. 
Rather than browsing individual NFT marketplaces separately, users can access a larger selection of NFTs from multiple marketplaces through an aggregator.
